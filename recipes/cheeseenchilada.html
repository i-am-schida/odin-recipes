  <h3>Origin</h3>
  
  <p class="origin-p">Cheese enchiladas are a mouthwatering Mexican dish consisting of soft corn tortillas filled with a generous amount of melted cheese and smothered in a rich and flavorful enchilada sauce. To prepare these savory delights, the tortillas are typically briefly heated to make them pliable before being rolled around the cheese filling. They are then placed in a baking dish, covered with more sauce, and baked until the cheese is gooey and bubbling. The result is a comforting and satisfying meal that combines the creaminess of the cheese with the bold flavors of the sauce, making cheese enchiladas a favorite comfort food for many.</p>
  <p class="origin-p">Cheese enchiladas are often garnished with toppings like sour cream, chopped cilantro, diced onions, and sometimes a sprinkle of crumbled queso fresco for added texture and flavor. Whether served as a hearty main course or as part of a larger Mexican feast, these enchiladas are a delightful combination of simplicity and indulgence, making them a beloved classic in Mexican cuisine.</p>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
  
      <ol class="steps">
        <li><strong class="bold-text">Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li><strong class="bold-text">Prepare the Filling:</strong>
            Grate the cheese.
            If using onions, chop them finely and sauté them until translucent.</li>
        <li><strong class="bold-text">Prepare the Enchilada Sauce:</strong>
            If using store-bought sauce, you can skip this step. If making your own sauce, follow your chosen recipe to prepare it.</li>
        <li><strong class="bold-text">Heat the Tortillas:</strong>
            In a skillet or on a griddle, heat each corn tortilla for a few seconds on each side until they become soft and pliable. You can also heat them in the microwave with a damp paper towel.</li>
        <li><strong class="bold-text">Assemble the Enchiladas:</strong>
            Lay a tortilla flat and place a generous amount of grated cheese in the center.
            Optionally, add sautéed onions, black olives, or other desired toppings.
            Roll the tortilla tightly around the filling and place it seam-side down in a greased baking dish. Repeat for all tortillas.</li>
        <li><strong class="bold-text">Cover with Enchilada Sauce:</strong>
            Pour the prepared enchilada sauce evenly over the rolled tortillas in the baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong class="bold-text">Add More Cheese:</strong>
            Sprinkle additional grated cheese on top of the enchiladas.</li>
        <li><strong class="bold-text">Bake:</strong>
            Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted, and the enchiladas are heated through.</li>
        <li><strong class="bold-text">Garnish and Serve:</strong>
            If desired, garnish with sour cream, chopped cilantro, jalapeño peppers, and extra black olives.
            Serve the cheese enchiladas hot and enjoy!</li>
