  <h3>Origin</h3>
  <p>A BLT sandwich is a classic and beloved American creation, celebrated for its simple yet irresistible combination of flavors and textures. Crispy bacon, cooked to golden perfection, serves as the savory foundation, followed by thick slices of ripe, juicy tomatoes, and fresh, crisp lettuce leaves. These ingredients are harmoniously brought together between slices of toasted bread, typically spread with creamy mayonnaise. The smoky saltiness of the bacon, the refreshing sweetness of the tomatoes, and the crunch of the lettuce create a delightful contrast, making the BLT a timeless sandwich that satisfies both the palate and the soul.</p>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Cook the Bacon:</strong> 
        In a skillet or on a griddle, cook the bacon strips until they are crispy and golden brown. Drain excess fat on paper towels.</li>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Prepare the Bread:</strong>
        While the bacon is cooking, you can toast the slices of bread if desired. Toasting adds a nice crunch to the sandwich.</li>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Spread Mayonnaise:</strong>
        Lay out the slices of bread, and spread a generous layer of mayonnaise on one side of each slice.</li>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Layer Lettuce:</strong>
        Place fresh lettuce leaves on one slice of bread. The lettuce serves as a crisp base for the other ingredients.</li>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Add Tomato Slices:</strong>
        Lay slices of ripe tomato on top of the lettuce. Season the tomatoes with a pinch of salt and pepper for added flavor.</li>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Arrange Bacon Strips:</strong>
        Arrange the cooked bacon strips on top of the tomato slices. You can break the bacon in half for easier eating.</li>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Optional Ingredients:</strong>
        If you're adding optional ingredients like avocado slices, cheese, thinly sliced onion, or mustard, layer them on top of the bacon.</li>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Top with Second Bread Slice:</strong>
        Place the second slice of bread, mayonnaise-side down, on top of the bacon and other ingredients to form a sandwich.</li>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Slice and Serve:</strong>
        Use a sharp knife to slice the BLT sandwich in half diagonally or straight across. This makes it easier to handle and eat.</li>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Enjoy:</strong>
        Your classic BLT sandwich is ready to enjoy! Serve it immediately, and savor the combination of flavors and textures.</li>
