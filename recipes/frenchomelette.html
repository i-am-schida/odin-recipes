  <h3>Origin</h3>
  <p>A French omelette is a culinary masterpiece that elevates the simple egg into a work of art. Prepared with finesse and precision, this iconic dish is known for its creamy, almost custard-like interior and delicate, tender exterior. To create a French omelette, eggs are gently beaten, seasoned with a touch of salt and pepper, and then cooked in a hot, buttered pan. The key to perfection lies in the careful, quick, and continuous stirring as the eggs coagulate, forming soft curds. The omelette is typically folded over itself, creating a velvety, seamless texture, and is often garnished with fresh herbs or a sprinkle of cheese. The result is a luxurious, melt-in-your-mouth creation that showcases the artistry of French culinary technique.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    <li>Optional: herbs, cheese, vegetables, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Prep the Eggs:</strong> 
        Crack the eggs into a bowl, and season them with a pinch of salt and a dash of pepper. Use a fork or whisk to gently beat the eggs until the yolks and whites are fully combined.</li>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Preheat the Pan:</strong>
        Choose a non-stick skillet or omelette pan. Heat the pan over medium-low to medium heat until it's warm but not too hot.</li>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Add Butter:</strong>
        Add a generous pat of unsalted butter to the pan (about 1-2 tablespoons per omelette). Allow the butter to melt and coat the bottom of the pan evenly.</li>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Pour in the Eggs:</strong>
        Once the butter is foamy but not browned, pour the beaten eggs into the pan.</li>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Stir Gently:</strong>
        As the eggs start to cook, use a spatula to gently stir and push the eggs from the edges toward the center. This creates soft curds.</li>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Continue Stirring:</strong>
        Continue to stir and gently push the eggs around the pan. Be patient and maintain low to medium heat to avoid overcooking.</li>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Fold and Shape:</strong>
        When the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny on top, stop stirring. Let the omelette set for a moment.
        If adding fillings (e.g., cheese or herbs), now is the time to place them on one side of the omelette.</li>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Fold the Omelette:</strong>
        Using the spatula, carefully fold one side of the omelette over the other, creating a half-moon shape. Press gently to seal.</li>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Slide onto Plate:</strong>
        Tilt the pan and slide the omelette onto a serving plate, folded side down.</li>
    <li><strong class="bold-text">Serve Immediately:</strong>
        A classic French omelette is best when served hot and fresh. Garnish with additional herbs, salt, and pepper if desired.</li>
